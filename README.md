<b>The purposes of this application are:</b>

  1) To help a local nonprofit move away from local-server dependent sign-in application to a web application.
  
  2) Selfishly, for me to learn react and redux. 
  The application itself is not naturally a single page application, so it was forced to be one in many ways.

  The email is my email. 
  
  The password is "password".
  
  Feel free to modify employees, modify programs and search for a specific person.

<b>Future adjustments/improvements (scheduled for December 2016):</b>
  The forms will be broken into smaller individual components of form types.
  For example, instead of repeating exact same codes in clients and volunteers, 
  I will break the forms into input component, select component etc. Each type of form will then call these components.
  Each component will handle its own validation if applicable.
  
  Volunteer hours will be modified to render correctly.
  
  I will look into smoother transition as feedback for form submission.
  
  Dynamic resizing?
